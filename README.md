# ProcrastiNOT

A network-wide system to prevent yourself from procrastinating. ProcrastiNOT is designed to leave you no option but to do what you should actually should/need/want to do, by letting you configure what is blocked on your devices and how, while also giving you a difficult time disabling the blocks.

ProcrastiNOT has a server/client architecture, where the clients are applications that control the blocks, and the server gives information to all the different clients about the current system configuration. For example, the server can be configured to block "Games", "YouTube" and "Netflix", which a client for PC can decide to block Steam, and a network client will block YouTube and Netflix domains.
Clients should also ensure a "workaround" of sort to the blocks, so as to not be abused and to allow an emergency out in case needed.
